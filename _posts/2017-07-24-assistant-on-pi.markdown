title: Home Automation with Voice Commands

With the Google Assistant SDK being released, speech-based home projects received a powerful new component in its arsenal and with this I thought it's about time for me to jump on the home assistant hype train!
The Google Assistant will be implemented on a Raspberry Pi, which makes it a potentially more powerful and much cheaper system than the Google Home device and along with fun and joy we will hopefully learn a thing or two.

This project contains a wide variety of features among which are:
- Google Assistant running on a Raspberry Pi
- use a bluetooth remote to initiate request to Google Assistant
- execute shell commands with Google Assistant, IFTTT and Home Assistant
- switch on/off devices connect directly to wall plug and ceiling lights using relay modules

If you want to use this post as a guide or inspiration for your own projects, I am going to assume that you are already somewhat familiar with Linux systems and the Raspberry Pi, although I will try to not leave out any details on what I did. Alright, let's get right to it!

To start off, we first need to install the Google Assistant on a Raspberry Pi. Google provides a great guide for the installation: Link
