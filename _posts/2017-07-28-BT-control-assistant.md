title: Start Google Assistant via Bluetooth remote
excerpt: Hotword detection is an impressive and convenient feature, but has with a big drawback&#58; it comes at the price of sacrificing part of our privacy. To address this issue, we can use a Bluetooth remote button to trigger a query.

After successfully running the Google Assistant on the Raspberry Pi [**Link**](http://www.atwing.net/#projectModal-assistant-pi), we proceed with initiating a voice command with a Bluetooth remote. The motive behind this is that even though starting a query with a hotword is a great feature, we might not want the Assistant to always listen - especially if you tend to paranoia like I do. We could instead physically start a conversation and preferably from any part of the house.  
One quite cheap solution that I found is using Bluetooth remote buttons that cost less than [**two bucks online**](https://www.amazon.com/UFCIT-Bluetooth-Wireless-Control-Smartphones/dp/B00LUNAA2O/) and with Bluetooth LE the electricity bill will be happy too. Three birds with one stone!
