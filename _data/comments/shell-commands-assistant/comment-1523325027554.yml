  Followed all steps, but when I try to run the command from Google Assistant,
  it doesn't go through.  IFTTT seems to be failing and gives ETIMEDOUT error. 
  My shell command works from the Home Assistant web gui, and Google Assistant
  provides the correct response to the IFTTT request.  Any help?
