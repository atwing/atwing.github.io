Greetings and welcome!<br>
I am a soon-to-be Machine Learning Engineer currently studying at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. While getting a degree in Telecommunication engineering in Germany, the contagious excitement of recent advancements in Machine Learning drove me into the world of Artificial Intelligence. I began doing projects in Signal Processing and Speech Recognition - one of the many areas that benefit greatly from ML methods.

In my blog I write about projects in Machine Learning, Home Automation and Information Security to give back the enthusiasm received from the Open Source & DIY community. I would be delighted to see you use my projects as guidance and inspiration for your own hacks.<br>
These are excitingly chaotic times to live in and too great to miss out on!

Available for hire.
